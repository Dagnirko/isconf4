Changeset 102 fixes two bugs (28 and 34) which involve changes to the
repository.  Since we're still in prerelease versions, I haven't
provided automatic upgrade code.  Here are the changes:

mv cache/example.com/volume/generic/block cache/example.com/

    ...you can do this by hand on one machine, and it will propogate
    to the rest.

Add a timestamp (seconds since epoch) as the first column of history.

    ...if you're just testing, you can blow away history and it will
    get recreated (all of the transactions will be re-run, of course),
    or you can run it through perl, awk, whatever to add a bogus
    timestamp sometime in the recent past (the timestamp shows the
    time the change was applied on the local machine).

There is one more set of bugs (33 and 38) which are likely to cause
incompatible changes in the repository.  These will need to get closed
before 4.2.6 goes into final release; after that any repository layout
changes must be detected and handled by the code itself.
