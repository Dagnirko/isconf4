<H1>QUICK START</H1>
<P>
To install the latest version of package 'foo' on ten thousand hosts,
including any hosts that are currently down or not yet built, you can
log into the first host and say this:
</P>
<PRE>
      cd /tmp
      wget http://example.com/foo-1.2.tar.gz  
      isconf snap foo-1.2.tar.gz  
      isconf exec tar -xzvf foo-1.2.tar.gz 
      isconf exec make -C foo-1.2 install
      isconf exec rm -rf foo-1.2.tar.gz foo-1.2
      isconf ci
</PRE>
<P></P>
<P>
...then, on the other 9,999 hosts, run this during boot or from cron:
</P>
<PRE>
      isconf up
</PRE>
<P></P>
<A NAME="toc4"></A>
<H1>BACKGROUND</H1>
<P>
One hundred years ago, automobiles were built by hand.  Each vehicle
was unique, composed of parts which were often crafted on the spot.
Repairs were expensive and frequent, owners needed to be mechanics,
fleetwide engineering changes were non-existent.
</P>
<P>
Then came mass production.  Today, a single automotive assembly line
produces vehicles of varying colors and options, all built from the
same basic design and tooling.  Replacement parts are interchangeable;
technicians bolt engineering changes onto existing vehicles with a
reasonable expectation that the parts will fit.  Economies of scale
have led to highly optimized designs, performance, and usability.
Drivers turn the key and go.
</P>
<P>
Most IT departments are nowhere near that sort of capability; they
still install and maintain operating systems and applications by hand.
Each machine is unique, reliability is elusive, users become
technicians, fixes often require re-engineering, most outages are
caused by other fixes, and infrastructure-wide changes are fraught
with peril if they are possible at all.  Even basic security patches
are, as a rule, applied sporadically.
</P>
<P>
ISconf provides some of the standardized tooling needed for
deterministic, reproducible management of UNIX machines -- the kind of
reproducibility you can count on for consistency, disaster recovery,
reliability, security, and auditability.  ISconf manages hosts over
their entire lifecycle following initial install, allowing you to
continue to test and deploy both major and minor changes well after
the target hosts have been placed into production service.  With this
tool you can safely replace kernels and bootloaders, install new
patches, packages, and tarballs, run arbitrary commands, and even
re-install the entire operating system under program control, and do
it all in a way that can be consistently reproduced on other current
or future machines.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, users of earlier versions of ISconf have found
that this consistency gives systems administrators enough breathing
room to "get ahead of the ticket curve", reclaim more of their nights
and weekends, and to, finally, begin to do more engineering and less
firefighting.
</P>
<A NAME="toc5"></A>
<H1>DESCRIPTION</H1>
<P>
See the GLOSSARY below for terms and concepts.
</P>
<P>
ISconf can be thought of as a cross between <B>sudo</B>(8) and a
distributed version control tool like Git or Bitkeeper.  Changes you
make via ISconf are journaled and added to a distributed repository,
queuing them for execution on other target machines.  Those other
target machines do not need to be running, or even be built, at the
time you check in changes.  As you turn on, build, reboot, and/or run
'isconf up' on other machines, ISconf consults the journal and
executes the same changes, in the same order, on each machine.
</P>
<P>
The ISconf architecture is completely peer-to-peer; there are no
central servers or other single points of failure, and it is designed
for use in partially-partitioned networks such as DMZ environments.
The command-line client talks to a daemon which runs on each
machine.  The daemon, usually started at boot, handles distributed
file storage, locking, and network communications.
</P>
<P>
ISconf is not intended for use in environments where you want to make
manual, ad-hoc, or other out-of-band changes to machines.  If you
don't have the will to rebuild all of your machines from scratch so
you know what's on their disks, don't care about disaster recovery,
don't need to keep any of your machines in lock-step with each other,
don't need to test O/S changes before deploying them to production,
aren't as interested in O/S patch management, or still want to log in
as root on target machines and make arbitrary untracked changes, then
you don't want this package.  (You might, however, want
<B>cfengine</B>(8) -- see the bottom of this man page.)
</P>
<A NAME="toc6"></A>
<H1>PREREQUISITES</H1>
<P>
To do deterministic and repeatable host management, there are some
things you need to do in addition to just installing and using ISconf.
Above all, you need to maintain a reasonable level of control over the
root-owned bits which you place on your disks, both during initial
install as well as throughout their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
Automated systems administration is all about making self-modifying
code behave consistently.  If you don't start from a known state and
keep it that way, then you can make no assertions about how your
machines will behave in comparison with each other -- a change which
works on one host may not work on others.  Once you've destroyed this
consistency, you can no longer count on QA, disaster recovery, load
balancers, distributed applications, HA clusters, new deployments, or
even single machine rebuilds to work correctly.
</P>
<OL>
<LI>If two or more hosts are supposed to act the same, then you need to
install them from the same disk image.  This applies to rebuilds of a
single host as well as multiple installs of identical hosts.  See
<B>base image</B> in the glossary.
<P></P>
<LI>Your host install tool needs to be able to capture an image of an
existing machine, save it on an install server, then dump that image
onto subsequent machines verbatim, altering only those things which
are supposed to be unique, such as IP address and hostname.  Among
Linux installers, for example, systemimager meets this requirement;
kickstart does not.  Under Solaris, you'll need to use Flash Archives,
not Jumpstart.  See <B>checkpoint image</B> in the glossary.
<P></P>
<LI>After initial install, you need to manage hosts exclusively with
ISconf -- no manual or other out-of-band changes.  There is one
exception to this rule:  You might want to use another tool to manage
environmentally-influenced configuration files.  You'll want to manage
the binaries of that tool using ISconf, and take care to ensure that
the external tool manages only those files which it must.  See
<B>environmental configuration files</B> in the glossary for more
discussion.
</OL>

<A NAME="toc7"></A>
<H1>FLAGS</H1>
<P>
Flags appear only after the isconf command name, not after
subcommands (as opposed to e.g. CVS).
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>-c</B> <I>config</I>  </DT><DD>
    Top-level configuration file.  Defaults to /etc/is/main.cf.  See
    CONFIGURATION for details.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-D</B></DT><DD>
    Show debug info on stderr.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-m</B></DT><DD>
    Message -- human-readable comment describing the change.  Required
    only when locking.  This flag is deprecated and is likely to be
    removed; see the 'lock' verb below for how to provide the message 
    in a forward-compatible way.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-r</B></DT><DD>
    Allow reboot if needed.  Used only with the 'up' verb below.  Also
    see the 'reboot' verb.
    Ordinarily you would execute 'isconf -r up' from an rc script,
    which is a relatively safe time to allow reboots.  
<P></P>
    This flag has no effect unless there is a 'reboot' operation
    pending in the journal.  If there is a 'reboot' pending, then this
    flag allows the reboot to take place.   You only want to provide
    this flag at times when it's safe to reboot the local machine.
<P></P>
    Without this flag, if 'isconf up' encounters a 'reboot' operation
    during journal replay, the replay stops, an error message is
    issued, and subsequent changes are not applied.  You'll need to
    run 'isconf -r up' to continue past this point -- we cannot assume
    that the later changes will work without the reboot.
<P></P>
<DT><B>-q</B></DT><DD>
    Quiet -- don't show verbose output.
</DL>

<A NAME="toc8"></A>
<H1>SUBCOMMANDS</H1>
<P>
Subcommands are often called 'verbs' in ISconf documentation and
usage.  They can be grouped into the following categories:
</P>
<A NAME="toc9"></A>
<H2>Locking</H2>
<P>
    lock, unlock
</P>
<A NAME="toc10"></A>
<H2>Changing disk state</H2>
<P>
    snap, exec, reboot, ci, up
</P>
<A NAME="toc11"></A>
<H2>Branch management</H2>
<P>
    fork, migrate
</P>
<A NAME="toc12"></A>
<H2>Daemon management</H2>
<P>
    start, stop, restart
</P>
<P>
The following is a detailed description of all subcommands, in
alphabetical order.  In these descriptions, the <B>origin</B> host is the
host where a user executes <B>lock</B>, <B>snap</B>, <B>exec</B>, <B>reboot</B>,
or <B>ci</B>, and the <B>target</B> host is where a user executes 
<B>up(date)</B>.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>ci</B></DT><DD>
    Check in local changes, such as <B>snap</B> or <B>exec</B>, and release
    branch lock.
<P></P>
    Run on origin.
<P></P>
<DT><B>exec</B> <I>command args ...</I></DT><DD>
    Execute an arbitrary command.  Causes the command to be executed
    immediately on the local machine, and queued for
    execution on target machines after <B>ci</B>.
<P></P>
    Example:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      isconf lock "permanently shut down apache"
      isconf exec /etc/rc2.d/S85apache stop
      isconf exec rm /etc/rc2.d/S85apache 
      isconf ci
</PRE>
<P></P>
    If you want to embed shell redirects or pipes in the <B>exec</B>
    arguments, then you'll need to wrap the arguments in a shell
    invocation.  For example, this *won't* do what you want -- it will
    only change /etc/motd on the origin machine:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      isconf exec echo web server down &gt; /etc/motd
</PRE>
<P></P>
    Here's what you really want instead:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      isconf exec sh -c "echo web server down &gt; /etc/motd"
</PRE>
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>fork</B> <I>newbranch</I></DT><DD>
    Create a new branch from the current branch, and migrate the local
    host onto the new branch.  The
    original branch is the "parent" branch, and the new branch is the
    "child" branch.  
<P></P>
    If host A executes a <B>fork</B>, then it is the only host moved to
    the
    branch; hosts B and C do not change.  If you want B or C to move
    to the new branch as well, see <B>migrate</B>.
<P></P>
    Low-level implementation:  Since a journal describes the details
    of a branch, then a fork essentially just copies the entire
    journal contents from the parent branch into a new journal named
    after the child branch, then runs the <B>migrate</B> code path.
<P></P>
<DT><B>lock</B> <I>message</I> ...</DT><DD>
    Lock the branch.  Required before <B>snap</B>, <B>exec</B>, <B>reboot</B>,
    or <B>ci</B>, and recommended before <B>fork</B> and <B>migrate</B>.  The
    <I>message</I> will be recorded in the journal for each subsequent
    transaction until the next <B>ci</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>migrate</B> <I>branchname</I> </DT><DD>
    Migrates the local host onto a new branch.  In human language
    this means the host is going to change roles.  
<P></P>
    Switching a host to a new branch is only possible if the new
    branch is a child of the host's old branch, and if there have been
    no transactions executed on the host since the new branch was
    forked off -- in other words, the new branch's journal content
    needs to be a contiguous superset of the old branch's journal
    content.  If these conditions aren't met, <B>migrate</B> will
    exit with a non-zero return code.
<P></P>
<DT><B>reboot</B> </DT><DD>
    Reboots the machine.  Before reboot, adds a journal entry which
    will cause all target machines on this branch to reboot at the same
    point in their build.   For example, this is what you might do to
    install and boot a new kernel:
<P></P>
<PRE>
      isconf lock "upgrade to 2.6.20"
      isconf snap kernel-2.6.20-1.i686.rpm
      isconf exec rpm -ivh kernel-2.6.20-1.i686.rpm
      isconf reboot
      isconf ci
  
      # on other machines
      isconf -r up
</PRE>
<P></P>
    Apply thought when using this verb; 'isconf up' (without the -r)
    won't finish if there is a 'reboot' pending as the next action in
    the journal.  You need 'isconf -r up' -- and you don't want to put
    that in crontab, unless you really don't mind your
    machines rebooting at that time.  See the <B>-r</B> flag for details.
<P></P>
    Never say 'isconf exec reboot' -- that will only reboot the local
    machine, and will never create any sort of journal entry; the
    reboot kills isconf itself before the journal entry can be made.
    Always say 'isconf reboot' instead.
<P></P>
    By default, ISconf runs 'shutdown -r now' to cause the reboot.  If
    you want or need to use a different command, see the IS_REBOOT_CMD
    environment variable below.
<P></P>
<DT><B>restart</B></DT><DD>
    Restart the daemon.  Equivalent to a <B>stop</B> followed by a
    <B>start</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>snap</B> <I>filename</I></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Snapshot a file for install on target machines.  Preserves the current 
    contents, permissions, and mode bits of the file.
    After <B>ci</B>, any target host on the same branch can
    run 'isconf up', which will cause ISconf to install the file on 
    the target host.
</DL>

<DL>
<DT><B>start</B></DT><DD>
<DT><B>stop</B></DT><DD>
    Start or stop the daemon.
<P></P>
<DT><B>unlock</B> </DT><DD>
    Break the lock on the local branch.  
    Use with great care.  
    This reverses the effect of a 
    <B>lock</B>, invalidates the work stored in <B>journal.wip</B> on
    the locking machine, and will likely require the person who set
    the lock to discard their work and/or rebuild the machine where
    the lock was made.  
<P></P>
    Generally speaking, it's better to pick up the telephone and call
    the person who set the lock, asking them politely to finish
    whatever they were doing and check it in, rather than use this
    subcommand.
<P></P>
<DT><B>up</B> </DT><DD>
    Update.  Causes the isconf daemon to attempt execution of any new 
    transactions in the
    journal.  Errors and messages are copied to stderr and stdout of
    <B>isconf</B> as well as to syslog.  Exits with a non-zero return
    code in case of error.
<P></P>
    If used with <B>-r</B>, and if a pending <B>reboot</B> entry is 
    encountered in the journal, then the host will reboot.
</DL>

<A NAME="toc13"></A>
<H1>ENVIRONMENT</H1>
<P>
ISconf behavior is controlled predominantly by environment
variables.  These can be set and exported before starting or
restarting the isconf daemon, or can be set in configuration
files, usually <B>main.cf</B>.  Any
variables set in the environment will be overridden by those set
in the configuration file.
</P>
<DL>
<DT><B>IS_DOMAIN</B> </DT><DD>
    ISconf domain name -- more or less equivalent to an AFS cell name
    or a Kerberos realm name; all of the machines sharing this name
    will share in the distributed cache that makes up the ISconf
    repository.  Normally you'd want all of the machines in a given
    legal entity -- the same corporation, for instance, to use the
    same domain name.   This is an arbitrary string, but by convention it
    is usually based on the DNS domain name.
<P></P>
    Rather than set this in an environment variable, you're better off
    populating the <B>/var/is/conf/domain</B> file, below.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_HOME</B> </DT><DD>
    The base directory which ISconf uses for data storage.  Defaults
    to <B>/var/is</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_HTTP_PORT</B> </DT><DD>
    The port number which each ISconf HTTP server listens on.  Used only for
    file fetches between machines, and is likely to be deprecated in a
    near-future release.  Defaults to port 65028.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_NETS</B> </DT><DD>
    The name of a file which contains a list of broadcast and/or host
    addresses which ISconf should advertize file updates to.  See
    <B>nets</B> file below.  Likely to change in a future release.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_PORT</B> </DT><DD>
    The port number which ISconf daemons use to communicate between each
    other.  Right now this is UDP only, but TCP will be added in
    4.2.7, and UDP is likely to be deprecated.  Defaults to port 65027.
<P></P>
<DT><B>IS_REBOOT_CMD</B> </DT><DD>
    The command which ISconf uses to reboot the machine in response to
    an 'isconf reboot' request.  Defaults to "shutdown -r now".
</DL>

<A NAME="toc14"></A>
<H1>FILES</H1>
<DL>
<DT><B>/etc/is/main.cf</B></DT><DD>
    Top-level configuration file for ISconf.

    XXX show format -- for now just see t/simple.conf.
<P></P>
<DT><B>/var/is</B></DT><DD>

<A NAME="toc15"></A>
<H1>GLOSSARY</H1>
<DL>
<DT><B>base image</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    An image which was created directly from vendor CD or another
    external source, and which contains an empty journal.  Normally as
    simple as possible, with only a management tool (such as ISconf)
    and its prerequisites added.  
<P></P>
    You will usually create only one base image per platform -- see
    <B>one-base</B>.
<P></P>
    Base images are named using an arbitrary ASCII string.
    Recommended practice is to use platform name followed by a dash
    and the domain name of your organization, as in
    <I>linux_debian_i686-t7a.org</I>
    or <I>solaris_5.8_sparc-arc.nasa.gov</I>.
    Because you will usually only create one base image for each
    platform, a version number isn't needed.
<P></P>
    If you for some reason do find yourself creating a second base
    image for the same platform, then first examine what you're doing
    and re-read the one-base definition.  If you still want to do
    this, then recommended practice is to add another dash and then
    then version number, as in <I>aix_4.X_rs6000-langley.af.mil-2</I>.  
<P></P>
<DT><B>categories of data</B></DT><DD>
    There appear to be three categories of data on the disk of a
    typical UNIX machine:
<P></P>
    <OL>
    <LI>root-owned binaries and non-environmental configuration data
    <LI><B>environmental configuration files</B> (see glossary entry)
    <LI>user or business data
    <P></P>
    </OL>
<DT><B>checkpoint image</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    An offline copy of the disk image of a given branch at a given
    revision, used for speedier installs.  A checkpoint image is made
    by installing a host from an ancestor checkpoint or base image,
    allowing its branch's journal entries to execute, then capturing
    the resulting disk content.
<P></P>
<DT><B>environmental configuration files</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Configuration files whose content is predominantly influenced by
    external business, political, procedural, or economic factors.
    Examples include files containing registered IP addresses, license
    keys, user names, and other information which is not quite
    "business data" but acts a lot like it.  See also **categories of
    data**.
<P></P>
    These files need to be handled with special care and thought,
    because they generally can't be managed the same way you would
    manage a binary executable or a non-environmental configuration
    file.  There is still a lot of art in handling these files,
    because this is where the digital behavior of Von Neumann machines
    conflicts with the analog world of human organizations; there are
    no absolute rules which work in all cases.
<P></P>
    You may need external tools to manage some of these files, running
    on top of ISconf and hooked into e.g. your corporate LDAP or HR
    database -- see PREREQUISITES.  For instance, /etc/passwd and
    /etc/resolv.conf are both heavily influenced by external forces,
    and are both good candidates for external management, while
    /etc/services and /etc/inittab are much more influenced by local
    applications, and in most cases should be managed with a simple
    <B>isconf snap</B>.
<P></P>
<DT><B>one-base</B> </DT><DD>
<P></P>
    One-base is an axiom of ISconf (and probably deterministic host
    management in general) -- it says that a host of any branch can be
    created by installing the base image for that platform and then
    replaying that branch's journal.  This means you may only need one
    base image for any given platform -- starting from there you can
    use journal replay to morph the image into any other image which
    is described by a branch's journal.
<P></P>
        "One base to start them all, one base to gild them, one base to
        boot them all and in the darkness build them."
<P></P>
    Sorry.
<P></P>
<DT><B>branch</B> <a name=branch></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    Host model or type.  Similar usage as in software version control.
    A different branch is normally used for each set of hosts that
    need their own disk image and that do wildly different or
    conflicting things.  For example, a DNS server and a database
    server would tend to be on different branches.
<P></P>
    A branch is described by the sequence of transactions in a
    journal.  A new branch is created by forking an existing branch.
<P></P>
    Branches are named with an arbitrary string of letters and numbers. 
<P></P>

    The transaction log of all changes made to a branch, starting from
    the base image.  Used for replay on other hosts of the same

<DT><B>class</B></DT><DD>
    This is an anti-definition: the word "class" should not be used to
    describe anything related to deterministic host management.  It
    brings with it misconceptions, such as "hosts can be subclassed",
    "changes in the parent class can be automatically and safely
    propagated to subclasses", and so on; most of these misconceptions
    imply that <I>editing history</I> is a safe thing to do.
<P></P>
<DT><B>editing history</B></DT><DD>
<P></P>
    "Editing history" is what happens when you build a machine based
    on a set of instructions, then alter the instructions that you
    used to build the machine.  Once you've done this, there is no
    mathematically provable way to ensure that your new
    instructions will still build the same machine, short of building
    the new machine and then comparing the entire disk content to the
    old one.  
<P></P>
    Editing history can create major outages when:
<P></P>
    <UL>
    <LI>you're trying to deploy changes which worked in QA (using the
      old instructions) to production (using the new instructions)
    <LI>you're trying to execute a disaster recovery, or even a single
      host rebuild, and you no longer have the old disk content available
    <LI>you're trying to add a new server to an existing farm and don't
      have time to resort to backups or run rsync across both disks
    <P></P>
    In ISconf, editing history would mean editing the journal file
    itself -- while there's nothing (currently) which would stop you
    from doing that, and while the resulting file would be dutifully
    distributed and applied to the target machines, it's highly
    discouraged and may be a lot more difficult to do in the future,
    as we add things like digital signatures and checksums to the mix.

<DT><B>install image</B></DT><DD>
    The bits placed on disk during installation; this will be either
    the base image or a checkpoint image taken from a child branch.

<H1>INTERNALS</H1>
<P>
The basic algorithm that ISconf uses is roughly:
</P>
    <UL>
    <LI>Journal the changes that are going to be made.
    <LI>Preserve all entries in the journal over the lifetime of the
      infrastructure.
    <LI>Only append entries to the journal -- never delete, never
      alter or re-order.
    <LI>Apply changes to one or more test machines by reading the
      journal.
    <LI>Maintain a history of changes that have been applied to each
      host.  The master copy of this history should reside on the
      local disk of that host, and must be destroyed if the disk 
      becomes corrupt or the host is rebuilt.
    <LI>Later, apply the same changes in the same order on other
      machines, by reading the same journal, using the same code path,
      consulting their local histories to see what is yet to be done.
    <LI>(This bullet point to be implemented as soon as possible after version
      4.2.6.139.) Keep track of those files which a human explicitly
      says do not need to be versioned, and in those cases (only),
      refer only to the last journal entry for those files.  An
      example is resolv.conf; in this case, you only want the most
      recent version to be applied, in order to ensure the host will
      function at all.  (But consider new configuration files, edited, 
      and deleted; these three operations actually need distinct
      handling.)
